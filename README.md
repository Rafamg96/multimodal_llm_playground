# multimodal_llm_playground
A playground for experimenting with Large Language Models and multimodal AI. This repository includes tests and prototypes across text, video, audio, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The goal is to explore capabilities, integrations, and workflows that combine different modalities into practical AI applications.
